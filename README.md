# Bhuk---A-Socio-Welfare-initiative

The problem Bhuk - A Socio Welfare initiative solves
Each year in India a whopping amount of 50Kg of food was thrown away per person every year in Indian homes Not just individual fellow contributes to it. India’s estimated 10 million weddings a year contribute significantly to its annual food waste.
According to the NGO Feeding Indians,10 to 20 percent of the food served at weddings goes to waste, and also the measures of food goes significantly high in places with an abundant supply of food like hostel mess.
Similarly goes with old books every year around 320 million of books and around 84 percent of our old items of clothing get dumped in landfills and incinerators.

So solving the above-mentioned problem we have come up with a SOCIO-WELFARE app NAMED BHUK.

it is not just the bulk of food, it's bhuk of education, bhuk of clothes, and many more essential commodities.

How our app will actually work?
What if you attend a wedding and you notice surplus food left, similarly in college hostels and other parties too.
You just raise a request for food available on our app and our app will connect you with nearby NGOs who can utilize the food.
The same goes with old items also, the requests of old books, clothes, furniture, and various other items raised by the NGO’s Orphanages and old age homes will be accepted by the people who are discarding their older belongings and with the help of our app, they can connect and simple transaction between one who is need of it and one who has surplus can take place.
Not just our app provides a platform for the NGO s, old age homes to make their connections more strong and more diverse but also helps in eradicating this major problem of concern.

So would you support us in our mission of fulfilling the appetite of everyone.

Challenges we ran into
Thinking of a platform which can solve this issue was one of our major challenges, but our case studies and research helped us in finding a way.
Structuring the realtime database was one of those taskes which requires sense of database management system where we have spent a lot of time to decide.
Making a Non-Profitable solution profitable by adding a revenue model isnt definetly everyone's cup of tea!! but here we did it!!
